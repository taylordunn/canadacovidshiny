This is a dashboard reporting the latest COVID-19 numbers and visualizing the trends over time, both overall and by province/territory.

It is currently being hosted on shinyapps.io here: https://taylor-dunn.shinyapps.io/canadacovidshiny/.

The app may be unavailable or not working at times, probably because it has reached the usage limit for the month (25 active hours).
For posterity, below is a screenshot of version 0.1.0 as of 2022-02-07:

The data come from the [Canadian COVID-19 Tracker API](https://api.covid19tracker.ca/docs/1.0/overview).
The data are periodically downloaded via the [`canadacovid` package](https://taylordunn.github.io/canadacovid/) to [this repository](https://github.com/taylordunn/canadacoviddata).
The Shiny app checks the data and will reactively update only when the data are new.
